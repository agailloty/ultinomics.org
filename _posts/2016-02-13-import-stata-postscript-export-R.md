title: Generating Postscript Images in Stata, Importing and Displaying them in R
excerpt: "Often it's easier to run econometric models and make graphs in Stata. But it's always easier to make a Beamer presentation in R Markdown! This is a post for people who want to import postscript files (.ps and .eps) generated in Stata but display them in R in different grid arrangements."
